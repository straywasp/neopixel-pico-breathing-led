# neopixel-pico-breathing-led
A MicroPython implementation of Apple's very nice "breathing" sleep LED for pi pico + neopixel WS2812 ring LEDS.

I have put too many comments in the python file, so there really isn't mucgh to add. Only tested in the simulator so far, until I wire up a real example.

Requires the neopixel library from here:

I'm not much of a python programmer, so if anyone spots a way of making this better, let me know!
